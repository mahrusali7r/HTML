    Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers important in a webpage's overall user experience. These metrics help measure how fast, responsive, and visually stable a webpage is. The three key metrics are:
</p>
<div>
    <h1>1. LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):</h1>
    <img src="/Assets/LCP.webp" alt="LCP" width="600">
    <p>This measures how long it takes for the largest piece of content on a page to load and be visible to the user. A good LCP ensures that the page loads quickly, making it feel fast.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>2. FID (First Input Delay):</h1>
    <img src="/Assets/FID.jpg" alt=""FID width="600">
    <p>This measures how quickly a page responds when a user first interacts with it, like clicking a button or a link. A low FID means the page is responsive and interacts smoothly.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>3. CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):</h1>
    <img src="/Assets/CLS.jpg" alt="CLS" width="600">
    <p>This measures how much the layout of a webpage shifts as it loads. A low CLS means the page is visually stable, so elements don't unexpectedly move around as the page loads.</p>
